# FAP - The Finite Automata Programmer

## Build and Install

***Currently only linux is supported***
1. Clone a repo
2. Run the **run_build.sh** in the command line
3. Pray it works and wait for a bit
4. Hopefully see the message that the binary is in the **dist** directory
5. Run it and pray once again
